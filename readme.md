JSVisionEditor
================

In active development! Documentation & Examples coming soon!     


Demo: https://jsvisioneditor.appspot.com   

This is an modified extension of FabricJS kitchen sink demo.     

The main idea is to allow rapid interaction between Computer Vision algorithms and a vector editing interface.    

Note: Concurrent with developing this project, I am trying to learn JavaScript. If you find out any obvious mistakes please do point them out.     



Coming soon:    
1. ConvnetJS integration and examples    
2. OpenCV integration using App Engine Managed VM
